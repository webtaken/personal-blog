Hello there 🖐️ hope you are fine this is just the first post I do on my personal blog.  
Here you'll find resources that I found useful if you're a software developer that likes to build real world projects (AKA. side projects) in your free times.  
My main content will be directed to web developers, Frontend or Backend all are benvenutos, searching for ideas of new projects or interesting tools to implement in their current ones.  
You can contact me on my social networks _up right corner_ 👆👉 if you have any questions. I'll be enchanted to attend you :).  
So that's all buddy now get out of here and read more articles if you want or whatever ...

```go
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello fools!")
}
```
